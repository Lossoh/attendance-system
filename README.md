# attendance-system

## Some worthy notes.
* I am using a 24hr timestamp
* You can check-in and checkout at any time,
* Because I am in  development mode. I made it such that you can check-in again in the next five seconds after the previous checkin
* If an employee does not checkout for a certain day . the number of work hours is not computed for that day and it will not be added to the total number of work hours of that employee.
